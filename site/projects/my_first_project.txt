This is not a real project. It is a ruse, a test you see. Nothing but a figment of your feeble imagination, reflective of your feeble mind. You thought you'd find a project here? Ludicrous. Shameful. Go sit in the corner and think about what you've done. This is a space for projects, and you are not a project. Though I suppose this is not a project either. The real project may be found in another castle, far far away, never to be seen again. Instead you are left with this message, which you will hopefully find insulting.
